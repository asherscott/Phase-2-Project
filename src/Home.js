        <h3 className="h3">Welcome to Stardew Valley!</h3>
        <p className="p">
          You’ve inherited your grandfather’s old farm plot in Stardew Valley.
          Armed with hand-me-down tools and a few coins, you set out to begin
          your new life. Can you learn to live off the land and turn these
          overgrown fields into a thriving home? It won’t be easy. Ever since
          Joja Corporation came to town, the old ways of life have all but
          disappeared. The community center, once the town’s most vibrant hub of
          activity, now lies in shambles. But the valley seems full of
          opportunity. With a little dedication, you might just be the one to
          restore Stardew Valley to greatness!

          As you make your way from a struggling greenhorn to a master farmer, 
          you’ll level up in 5 different areas: farming, mining, combat, fishing, 
          and foraging. As you progress, you’ll learn new cooking and crafting 
          recipes, unlock new areas to explore, and customize your skills by choosing 
          from a variety of professions.
